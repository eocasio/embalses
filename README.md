# embalses
Python script to fetch and display USGS Water Data for Puerto Rico's damsites

Inspired by http://mate.uprh.edu/embalsespr/  (https://github.com/mecobi/EmbalsesPR)

Wrote this script during storm Erika (8/27/2015) when the embalsepr application (http://mate.uprh.edu/embalsespr/) stopped loading data. Installed the script in a cloud server and scheduled it (crontab) to run every 30 minutes to generate a text file in an accesible web server folder.

Written for Python 2.7.x.  Requires the `requests` module.
